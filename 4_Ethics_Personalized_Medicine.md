# Ethics in Personalized Medicine
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing personalized medicine by tailoring treatments to individuals based on their genetics, lifestyle, and environment. However, this progress brings ethical concerns—particularly around bias, fairness, and transparency.

A major issue is data bias. Many AI models are trained on datasets like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which overrepresent individuals of European ancestry. As a result, treatment recommendations may be less accurate for underrepresented groups. For example, polygenic risk scores, used to predict disease susceptibility, often underperform for patients of African or Asian descent due to lack of diverse data.

Beyond genetics, social determinants of health—such as income, environment, and healthcare access—are often ignored in AI models. This omission can produce misleading or inaccessible recommendations, especially for underserved populations.

Algorithmic bias further compounds the problem. If models learn from biased historical data, they can perpetuate healthcare disparities. For instance, if past data reflects unequal treatment across races or genders, AI systems may reinforce those inequalities unless bias-mitigation steps are taken.

To promote fairness, key strategies include:

Diversifying training data through partnerships with global biobanks and inclusive clinical studies.

Implementing fairness-aware algorithms to detect and correct bias.

Providing explainability using tools like SHAP or LIME so patients and clinicians understand AI decisions.

Auditing AI systems through interdisciplinary teams including ethicists and patient advocates.

Ethical AI in medicine should reflect the principles of justice (equitable care), autonomy (informed patients), and beneficence (improved outcomes). By addressing bias at both the data and algorithmic level, we can ensure that personalized medicine is not only innovative but also inclusive and equitable for all.
